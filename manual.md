####Terminology
After signing up, please create a new Block to continue. In short, we create new Blocks and add Bricks in them. Here is some explanation for Block and Brick.
  1. **Block** refers to a shorterm goal, an ambitious project, a specific purpose, or anything else wanted, contains multiple Bricks.
    + __Create__  --Click *New Block* on the navigation bar to create a new one.
    + __Check__  --To view recent Bricks in a specific Block, click the *check* button following the Block's status column.
    + __Status__ --A Block's status is either *Active* or *Sleep*, can be changed when updating this Block. Sleeping Blocks will absent from Charts#02.
    + __Void__ --A Block named *Void* is auto-generated and self-maintained, it calculates the amount of ALL Unrecorded time.
  2. **Brick** represents each time period invested to reach a goal, to complete a project, or to serve a purpose.
    + __Add__  --To add a new Brick in a specific Block, click the *build* button following the Block's status column.
    + __Delete__  --Awkward but true that Bricks can only be deleted when viewing that Block's all Bricks, by *(Block)check->more...->del*.

Table and charts meanings will be explained in further detail below.

####Table
Only one table stays on the Home page, showing general infomation about all the Blocks. Block-related operations may be performed via four buttons there.

####Charts
Six charts are placed on the Home page to help visualize time usage.
+ \#01 __Base line__      showing durations of last added 30 Bricks.
+ \#02 __Total duration__ gives the sum of all Bricks' durations in each Block.
+ \#03 __Block ratio__    illustrates numerical proportion of each Block's total duration against ALL Recorded time.
+ \#04 __Not decided__    as named, not decided yet...
+ \#05 __Against Void__   amount to Chart#02 including the *Void* Block.
+ \#06 __Struggling__     amount to Chart#03 including the *Void* Block.

Some of the charts might need at least one Brick to display properly.
