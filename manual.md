####Terminology
After signing up, please create a new Block to continue. In short, we create new Blocks and add Bricks in them. Here is some explanation for Block and Brick.
1. **Block** refers to a shorterm goal, an ambitious project, a specific purpose, or anything else wanted, contains multiple Bricks.
  + Create
  + Check
  + Status
  + *Void*
2. **Brick** represents each time period invested to reach a goal, to complete a project, or to serve a purpose.
  + Add
  + Delete
  + Duration

####Table
Only one table stays on the Home page, showing general infomation about all the Blocks. Block-related operations may be performed via four buttons in this table.

####Charts
Six charts are placed on the Home page to help measure efficiency.
+ \#01 __Base line__      showing durations of last added 30 Bricks.
+ \#02 __Total duration__ gives the sum of all Bricks' durations in each Block.
+ \#03 __Block ratio__    illustrates numerical proportion of each Block's total duration against ALL Recorded time.
+ \#04 __Not decided__    as named, not decided yet...
+ \#05 __Against Void__   amount to Chart#02 including the *Void* Block.
+ \#06 __Struggling__     amount to Chart#03 including the *Void* Block.

Some of the charts might need at least one Brick to display properly.
